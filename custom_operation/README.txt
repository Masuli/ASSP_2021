1) Learn to make a custom operation by doing the tutorial from the TCE manual chapter 3, page 22.
The manual can be found in Desktop/ASSP/manual

2) Evaluate the algorithms that you have created in other exercises and try to find out an operation that would speed up the algorithm. Design a custom operation and a custom function unit with simulated behavior and VHDL descriptions.

3) Verify the functionality on FPGA or ModelSim.
